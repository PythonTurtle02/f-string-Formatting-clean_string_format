This code demonstrates the use of the print function and the format method to display a list of names along with corresponding numbers. Here's an explanation of the code and the techniques used:

Names and Numbers: The code defines several variables (name1, name2, ..., name9) that hold different names associated with Naruto characters. Each name is assigned a number from 1 to 9, indicating a ranking or order.

Print Statements: The code uses the print function to display the names and numbers in a specific format. Each print statement follows a similar structure: print(f'{name:18} : number').

f-string Formatting: The f preceding the string indicates that it is an f-string, which allows for string interpolation and formatting. Within the string, curly braces {} are used to enclose expressions that will be replaced with their values.

Format Method: The format method is used within the f-string to format the output. In this case, it specifies the width of the field as 18 characters (:18). This ensures that each name is displayed in a column-like format, providing uniformity in the output.

Output: When the code is executed, the print statements are executed sequentially. Each name is displayed with its associated number, aligned in columns with a width of 18 characters. The output represents a list of Naruto characters and their rankings.
